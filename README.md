# ME 700 Assignment 1
This assignment sereves as an introduction to Python, Github, and good coding practices for mechanical computation.  This assigmnet is split into 3 parts: a warmup interacting with the bisection method, a fiorst part that works with Newton's Method, and a second part incorporating an elasto-plastic material model.

## Warmup Mechanics Tutorial 2
The problem shown in the second tutorial for the assignment warmup is adapted from problem 5.51 in Fundamentals of Fluid Dynamics by Munson, Young, & Okisshi 8th Edition.  The version used for the tutorial is as follows:

The hydraulic dredge shown in the figure below is used to dredge sand from river bottom.  Estimate the diameter of the propeller to hold the boat stationary with a thrust of 6650 lbf, assuming the specific gravity of the sand-water micture to be 1.2.
