# ME 700 Assignment 1
This assignment serves as an introduction to Python, Github, and good coding practices for mechanical computation.  This assignment is split into 3 parts: a warmup interacting with the bisection method, a first part that works with Newton's Method, and a second part incorporating an elastoplastic material model.

## Warmup Mechanics Tutorial 2
The problem shown in the second tutorial for the assignment warmup is adapted from problem 5.51 in Fundamentals of Fluid Dynamics by Munson, Young, & Okisshi 8th Edition.  The version used for the tutorial is as follows:

The hydraulic dredge in the figure below is used to dredge sand from the river bottom.  Estimate the propeller's diameter that holds the boat stationary with a thrust of 6650 lbf, assuming the specific gravity of the sand-water mixture to be 1.2.

## Generative AI Use

In this assignment, the only forms of Generative AI that were used were vsCode Copilot, which assisted in completing code and ensuring correct Python syntax, and Google Gemini, which was a result when looking up specific Python functions and library implementation.
